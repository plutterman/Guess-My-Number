Mayo enjoyer
You're about as useful as a chocolate teapot.
You're a few sandwiches short of a picnic.
You've got a face like a bulldog chewing a wasp.
You're as bright as a broken lightbulb.
You're a proper muppet.
You're a total berk.
You're as useful as a one-legged man in an arse-kicking contest.
You're a numpty.
You're daft as a brush.
You're a plonker.
You're as slow as a wet week.
You're as clumsy as a bull in a china shop.
You're as thick as two short planks.
You're a total berk.
You're a complete wally.
You're as clueless as a blindfolded bat.
You're a right tosser.
You're about as funny as a rubber crutch.
You're a real pea-brain.
You're as useless as a screen door on a submarine.
You're as boring as watching paint dry.
You're as dull as dishwater.
You're a proper bore.
You're a walking disaster.
