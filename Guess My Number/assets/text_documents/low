Mustard eater
You're a twit.
You're as daft as a brush.
You're a total prat.
You're as predictable as the British weather.
You're about as interesting as a blank wall.
You're a complete nonce.
You're as hopeless as a chocolate teapot.
You're as soft as a marshmallow.
You're a wet blanket.
You're a right git.
You're as awkward as a bullfrog in a ballet.
You're as lazy as a sloth on a Sunday.
You're a proper slacker.
You're as stubborn as a mule.
You're a proper div.
You're as noisy as a herd of elephants.
You're as nosy as a parker.
You're as irritating as a mosquito in a tent.
You're not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?
Are you always this dumb, or is today a special occasion?
It's like talking to a brick wall with you.
You're a walking advertisement for birth control.
The village called; they want their idiot back.
You're stupid.
