Chimpanzee brain
You're a twit
You're a total fusspot
You're a walking advertisement for birth control
I've met smarter sandwiches
You're a total lemon
You're a complete and utter plonker
You're the reason they put instructions on shampoo bottles
You're not the cream of the crop; you're the curdled milk
Among chimpanzees you must be intelligent
CRIKEY! IT'S A TIGER! Never mind, it's just an idiot
You don't matter. Give up.
You're a real pea-brain
You're as dull as a dishwasher
You're a numpty
You're a total prat
You're a complete nonce
You're as annoying as a mosquito at bedtime
You're as picky as a toddler
You're the reason the gene pool needs a lifeguard
Your face could turn milk sour
No eres inteligente
I hope your toilet seat will be warm when you're alone
You probably think .20 is larger than .2
I hope your pillow is uncomfortably warm on both sides
